You Start in the Academy hub with a basic magic attack that deals 20 damage at moderate range, around you are 3 Portals, each goes to a different Trial.

The Yellow Portal goes to rocky pillars in a thunderstorm, you must reach the end without falling or dying to pass the trial. At the end there is the Shock Staff with the Lightning Bolt Spell within.
The Blue Portal goes to an Ice Cave where you must defeat all of the Golems to unlock a Gate, behind this gate is the Tundra Staff with the Ice Shard Spell within.
The Red Portal goes to the Ring of Fire, where you will face off against an Elemental Demon. Managing to defeat the demon allows you to proceed to the end where the Pyro Staff is, and within it, the Fireball Spell.

Once you have all of the spells you can use them to destroy the gates at the Hub, each gate is color coded with the spell that can destroy them. Getting through all of the gates allows you to pick up a scroll that tells you that you have completed the Trials and are now officially an Archmage.

Shock deals 40, Blizzard deals 30, Fireball deals 50.

Note: Animations are split up between the enemies and the player rather than all on the Player, as previously discussed in the Zoom meeting.
